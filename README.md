# Rapid-File-Conversion
Rapid File Conversion is a serverless application built using Amazon Web Services (AWS) that automates file handling and metadata management. The project leverages AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, and Amazon DynamoDB to create a fully event-driven and scalable workflow — eliminating the need for traditional infrastructure management.
